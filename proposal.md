# Project Proposal

#### CompRobo Final Project: Swarm Cooperative Transport
#### Richard Gao and Anna Griffin


<br>

## What is the main idea of your project?
Swarm cooperative transport


## Provide some motivation for your project. Why does your team want to pursue this? What possible applications does the project have? Given our discussions in class, are there possible implications for society?

Our team is interested in learning more about swarm robotics. We think that this is a simple enough behavior that has multiple possible extensions where we can explore the field of swarm robotics. Having multiple robots coordinating to perform a transport task has many applications in the real world. This fleet of robots could go where humans cannot, and having many smaller robots performing a task is cheaper than one expensive robot. Also, we have only worked with one robot at a time thus far, we think that it will be an interesting challenge to get multiple working together. 


## MVP and stretch goal?
**MVP:** using multiple robots moving a single cube to a predetermined goal

**Possible Extensions:** the system now has multiple objects or objects of different shape. The swarm still has to collectively move the objects to the predetermined goal.
 
Preliminary Resources:<br>

## Rough Timeline
November 16/18 - Research algorithms and skim through papers. Decide on a framework to use.
 
November 23 - Have multiple robots working with teleop in a framework
 
November 25 - Thanksgiving break
 
November 30/2 - Have robots collectively move the object
 
December 7/9 - Have robots move with the object to a predetermined target location
 
December 17 - Final Presentation


## What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project?

We anticipate the robot simulation being the most risky part of this project. So far, we have only worked with one Neato in Gazebo. For this project, we will need to introduce multiple robots and possibly new ones like the Kilobots. 
 
Richard has tried working with swarm in Gazebo with the neatos, but encountered challenges. He hopes that given the other frameworks and documentation that Melinda has provided will help ease this process.



## Personal Goals and Project Alignment
**Richard:**
The project aligns well with my goals. As long as we finish the project and spread out the workload across the duration of the project, I can see myself succeeding. This is because by just completing the project, my goal of getting an understanding of multiple robot communication would be met, and if we are able to do this in a well structured manner, not saving all the work to the last minute, my other goals will be met.
 
**Anna:** 
The project and my personal goes are well aligned. It is a reasonably scoped project and we have a timeline of different checkpoints we want to hit from now to the end of the semester. This will hopefully keep us on track and help me achieve my goal of managing my time well. I also feel confident that all progress made during this project will increase my understanding of mulit-robot systems since that is the main focus of our project. Lastly, I believe that implementing a swarm algorithm that achieves cooperative transport is a key component of the project helping me meet my goal of diving deeper into the algorithms.
